How to update plates now

You can run the update_plate_library.sh script if you are on a system which has the bash shell
This does the steps below except the git commit and push. 

To run manually:

1) edit make_plate_library.go - this still works as before
2) go build in this directory
3) ./serialize > ../platelibrary.go
4) go test in this directory (check if any issues have arisen)
5) commit changes and push
